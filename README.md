# Interactive Foundations - Demos

This repository will host all the demo files for technical lectures.
You can find the recordings on [Panopto](https://ccarts.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=b36b3fc7-c33c-4d29-8b68-acc1013e33bf).

This repository will be updated each week as we review more material over the semester.
Please be sure to Fetch the latest code each week.

Feel free to copy and paste code from these examples into your own files.

Note: Make sure you experiment with the code by duplicating it within your own repository. That said, you won’t be able to Push to this repository, so even if you accidentally change these files, you don’t need to worry about overwriting the demo code for everyone.
